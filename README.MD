Welcome to the my Weather API!

Here are a few starter tips to using the API:

1) Download the project and install the node_modules (npm install)

2) Start the server from root (node index.js)

3) Head on over to http://localhost:3000/ and you should see an html page with a search bar.

4) Enter your location (i.e city) and wait for the page to be populated with weather cards for your query!

* There should be 4 weather cards displayed in the browser: Today's weather and the following 3 days.

If you have trouble running the project, I have also setup a CodePen for the client-side code and a Repl for the server-side code!

    Repl - https://repl.it/@AZIZSALIHI/MetaWeather-Server-Express


Note: * Incomplete queries will fetch a city that matches closest to your query. 
      * Also, not all cities are supported by the API (i.e Ottawa, Tampa Bay, etc.)
